# Tarragrue

## General strategy

- Tanks soak red circle ([Remnant: Soulforge Heat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=352398/remnant-soulforge-heat))
- Tanks soak purple circle ([Remanant: Mortregar's Echoes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=352389/remnant-mortregars-echoes))
- Everyone else soak grey circle ([Remnant: Upper Reaches' Might](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=352382/remnant-upper-reaches-might))

Try to get two people to take the stun immunity power. If no one gets it, we rotate immunities, BoPs and stun immunities like IBF.

Predator's Howl, Tremor totem rotation and dispells.

Bloodlust start.

# Eye of the Jailer

## General strategy

Bloodlust final phase.

### Phase 1 

- Soak circle to help friends not be kidnapped then run against the drag-in.
- Glare go left, use chains to go right. Mages can blink.

### Phase 2 (75, 50 and 25%)

- Spreading misery, drop your voidzone at the edges of the room.
- Desolation Beam spread so Chain Lightning doesn't spread.

### Phase 3

Like phase 1 but enraged. Lust and nuke.

# The Nine

## General strategy

Burn both minibosses hard but equal. Actual fight starts when first miniboss 15%, after this we need to kill off minibosses first before killing big boss.

Tank kicks Song of Dissolution on Signe.

Six possible abilities used by Word of Recall:

- Soak
- Dance
- Stack
- Shield
- Big spread
- Spread

# Remnants of Ner'Zhul

## General strategy

Malevolence: **Face outwards** and get dispelled. We use ping-pong strat so star marker gets dispelled first, all get knocked then orange gets dispelled.

Suffering: Tanks need to rotate boss so frontal hits an orb. Don't be lazy and get clapped by frontal. Beamz angry.

Once orb has been clapped by frontal, DPS it down and someone runs it to the edge and yeets it off.

Probably Bloodlust at the end.

# Soulrender Dormazain

## General strategy

Tormented Eruptions: Stand in safe pizza slice.
Warmonger Shackles: 5 groups of 3 people will be assigned to break the shackles. Run far to break, they inflict large raid damage so listen to Beamz.
Brand of Torment: If you're targetted you either move out of the raid when no adds alive or on top of adds otherwise.

# Painsmith Raznal

## General strategy

Line of balls: Kill skull but don't pad. We'll find you if you do.
Shadowsteel Chains: Move to the back of the raid and use your brains for once. Shuffle through the gaps one by one so make sure you go as quick as possible. If you're slow, your friends might die.

Above 70%, tank will yeet out. Don't stand on the edges orthogonal to the tank.

Intermission: Find the gap in the lines and go through. 

Between 70 and 40%, tank yets out but the lines move towards other side of the room. Step through.

Another intermission.

Below 40%, we lust and burn.

# Guardian of the First Ones

## General strategy

This is a DPS check. Big deeps. Also heelz. So we're stacked at all times as best as possible.

Purging Protocol: Happens when boss has 0 energy. Take X amount of hits before moving boss to orb to replenish energy.

Elimination Pattern: Stack on Beamz. Offtank stands on top of stack too and taunts after Sunder. Everyone soaks Obliterate.

# Fatescribe Roh-Kalo

## General strategy

Fated Conjunction, hug pizza slice. Like, literally stand next to it.
Call of Eternity: You become Taliban. Fuck off left first. Next set of bombers fucks off to the other side (right of the boss) so you don't get clapped by first set.
Invoke Destiny: Like Xy'mox tank bomb but also spawns add. Kill add. And kick add.

At 70%, most AIDS part of Sanctum happens. Perhaps second most AIDS, we haven't seen Bitchtits yet.

6 groups 2 people: 1 leader, 1 follower
The follower will ALWAYS stand on the rune, leader will only step on if CCW rotation is necessary.

In the final phase, only 2 circles will need to be moved. Same principle, only 2 groups this time.

# Kel'Thuzad

## General strategy

P1 -> P2 -> P1 -> P2 -> P1 -> P2 -> P3

P1: Fight adds, kill boss.
P2: Once boss 0%, split raid. Some people kill human KT, other half kill adds. Once human KT loses 33% HP, phase ends.
P3: Mix of P1 and P2 + soft enrage because zones grow big.

### Phase 1

Howling Blizzard: Find safe spot.
Oblivion's Echo: Important to stack with these so that adds are stacked and easily AoEable. Think about the pad.
Relentless Haunt: If ghost runs at you, stay away from it and hope friends kill it before it kills you.
Glacial Wrath: Spikes explode when 0% + DoT. We try to stack and heal through with CDs, might need to stagger if not possible.
Frost Blast: Ranged helps soak the blast and gets MD'd.
Soul Fracture: Tank mechanic, deal with it. Pick up the adds while DPS kills them.

### Phase 2:

Raid gets split up into two groups:
- Downstairs group: Melee + 2 mobile healers
- Upstairs: Interrupt Banshees and don't stand infront of Abominations.
